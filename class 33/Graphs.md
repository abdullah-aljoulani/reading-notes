## Graphs

**what is Graphs**

Graph is a fundamental data structure used to represent and analyze various relationships and connections between objects.

**why use Graphs**

Graphs are crucial because they can model a wide range of real-world scenarios, including social networks, transportation systems, web pages, and much more.

**Types of Graphs**

1- Directed Graph (Digraph): In this type of graph, edges have a direction, meaning they go from one node to another.
2- Undirected Graph: In an undirected graph, edges have no direction. They represent symmetric relationships, such as friendships in a social network.

**Graph Algorithms**

1- Dijkstra's Algorithm: Used to find the shortest path in weighted graphs with non-negative weights.
2- Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Used to find the shortest path in weighted graphs with negative weights.
3- Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithms: Like Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms, used to find the minimum spanning tree in a graph.
