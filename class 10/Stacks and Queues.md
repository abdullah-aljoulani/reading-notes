## Stacks and Queues

**Vocabulary/Definition List:**

1-Neural Network: A computational model inspired by the human brain's structure 
and functioning, used to solve complex problems and make predictions.

2-Neuron: The basic building block of a neural network that receives input, applies weights and biases, and produces an output.

3-Weight: A parameter that determines the strength of the connection between neurons in a neural network.

4-Bias: An additional parameter added to the input of a neuron that allows for fine-tuning of the output.

5-Activation Function: A mathematical function applied to the output of a neuron, introducing non-linearities to the neural network.

6-Backpropagation: The process of updating the weights of a neural network based on prediction errors during training.

**Cheat Sheet - Neural Network Structure:**
Input Layer: The layer that receives input data.

Hidden Layers: Layers between the input and output layers, responsible for processing information.

Output Layer: The final layer that produces the network's output.

Weights and Biases: Parameters that determine the strength and behavior of connections between neurons.

Activation Functions: Functions applied to the output of neurons, enabling non-linear transformations.

Backpropagation: The process of adjusting weights based on prediction errors to improve the network's performance.
