## Hash Tables

**What is a Hash Table?**

A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to specific positions in an array, often referred to as buckets or slots. It provides fast access to values based on their corresponding keys.

**How does a Hash Table work?**

The fundamental idea behind a hash table is to convert a key into an array index using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and performs calculations to produce a unique or nearly unique index within the array.

**Collision Resolution**

In practice, it is possible that two keys produce the same hash value, leading to a collision. There are several collision resolution techniques used in hash tables:

Separate Chaining: In separate chaining, each bucket in the hash table holds a linked list or some other data structure to store multiple key-value pairs with the same hash value.

Open Addressing: Open addressing is an alternative collision resolution technique where, upon collision, the algorithm searches for the next available slot in the array.

**Advantages and Considerations**
Hash tables have several advantages:

Efficient retrieval and insertion of key-value pairs (average constant time complexity, O(1)).
Flexibility in handling large amounts of data.
Widely used in various applications, including databases, caches, and symbol tables.
