## why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module?

Data structures and algorithms provide efficient ways to store and manipulate data, enabling effective problem-solving.

## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

each data structure have its own advantage and disadvantage so Its depend on the problem

## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

by use Base Cases

## Things I want to know more about

I want to know more about data structure and algorithm.
