## Event Driven Programming

**What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?.**

The native Node.js module that allows you to get started with Event Driven Programming is the "events" module. This module provides an EventEmitter class that serves as the foundation for building event-driven applications in Node.js.

**What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?**

Object-oriented programming (OOP) and event-driven programming (EDP) are two programming paradigms that can complement each other effectively. When used together, they provide a powerful and flexible approach for building complex applications.

**Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.**

Event-driven programming in the backend using Node.js is like a waiter at a restaurant efficiently taking and processing orders from multiple tables without waiting for one order to complete.
