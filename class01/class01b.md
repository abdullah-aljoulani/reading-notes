## Express

**Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.**

middleware acts as a mediator or facilitator between different components or departments. It helps coordinate the flow of information, data, and requests between these components, making the overall system more efficient and organized.

**Express is the most popular _______ .**

Express is the most popular Node.js web application framework.

**Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?**

When we say that Express is "unopinionated," it means that the framework does not enforce strict rules or impose a specific way of structuring or organizing your application. Instead, it provides a minimalistic set of functionalities and leaves most decisions up to the developer.

**What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?**

A module is a self-contained and reusable unit of code that encapsulates related functionality. It can consist of variables, functions, classes, or even other modules. Modules help organize code into logical and manageable units, promoting modularity in software development.

**Here's why modularity is useful to us as developers:**

1-Reusability: Modules can be reused in different parts of an application or in other projects.

2-Encapsulation: Modules allow you to encapsulate related code and data into a single unit, hiding the internal implementation details

3-Maintainability: When your codebase is divided into modular units, it becomes easier to understand, debug, and maintain.

## NPM

**What version of npm are you running on your machine?**

pg@8.10.0

**What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?**

npm install jshint

## TDD

**Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.**

Tests are important for a few reasons:

1-Quality assurance: Tests help ensure that the software performs as expected.

2-Confidence in changes: As software evolves and new features are added, it's essential to have confidence that these changes won't break existing functionality. 

3-Collaboration and communication: Tests serve as a form of documentation for the behavior and expectations of the software.

**What are three expected benefits of testing**

1-Bug detection:

2-Quality assurance

3-Code stability and maintainability

**Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.**

Individual pitfalls:

1-Overlooking edge cases

2-Tight coupling with implementation details

Team pitfalls:

1-Lack of communication and collaboration

2-Neglecting test maintenance

## CI/CD

**What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?**

1-Early detection of integration issues

2-Faster feedback and reduced debugging time

3-Improved collaboration and team productivity

**What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?**

Continuous Delivery (CD): Continuous Delivery is a software development practice where teams focus on making their software consistently ready for deployment. It emphasizes building a robust and reliable release pipeline that enables the software to be deployed to production at any time

Continuous Deployment (CDep): Continuous Deployment takes the concept of Continuous Delivery a step further. In Continuous Deployment, every successful change that passes the necessary quality checks is automatically deployed to production without manual intervention.

**Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background**

1-Version control 

2-Code hosting

3-Collaboration and pull requests

4-Continuous Integration and deployment
