useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management by providing a structured way to handle complex state logic and a mechanism for sharing that state across your application without the need for prop drilling. This combination is especially beneficial in larger React applications where state management can become challenging, as it promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability.
