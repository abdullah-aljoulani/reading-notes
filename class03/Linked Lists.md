## Linked Lists

**Introduction**

Linked lists are fundamental data structures used in computer science and programming. They provide an efficient way to store and manipulate data dynamically.

**What is a Linked List?**

A linked list is a collection of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, which store elements in contiguous memory locations, linked lists can be scattered across different parts of the memory.

**Why Use Linked Lists?**

1. Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically, making them suitable for scenarios where the size of the data may change frequently.

2. Insertion and Deletion: Adding or removing elements from a linked list is efficient, requiring only a few pointer adjustments.

3. Memory Utilization: Linked lists use memory efficiently as they allocate memory dynamically for each node, unlike arrays that require contiguous memory blocks.

**Types of Linked Lists**

1. Singly Linked List: Each node in a singly linked list contains data and a single reference to the next node.

2. Doubly Linked List: In a doubly linked list, each node has a reference to both the next and previous nodes, allowing traversal in both directions.

3. Circular Linked List: In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the first node, forming a loop.
