### AWS Lambda Basics

**What is AWS Lambda?**

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It enables developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers.

**Name some use cases for AWS Lambdas.**

1-Real-Time Data Processing: Lambda functions can process streaming data in real-time, making them ideal for applications that require immediate data analysis and response.
2-Image and Video Processing: Lambda can process images and videos, performing tasks such as resizing images, generating thumbnails, transcoding videos, and applying filters or watermarks.
3-Data Validation and Sanitization: Lambda functions can validate and sanitize user input or data before storing it in a database, improving data integrity and security.

**Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.**

"serverless" in the technology world means you don't have to worry about managing servers and infrastructure when you want to run your software applications or websites. Instead of renting and maintaining servers yourself, you use a service like AWS Lambda (provided by Amazon Web Services) that takes care of all the server-related tasks for you.

### CDN

**What is a CDN?**

is a distributed network of servers strategically placed in multiple locations worldwide. The primary purpose of a CDN is to deliver web content, such as images, videos, stylesheets, scripts, and other static assets, to users with high performance and low latency.
